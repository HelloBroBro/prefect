Title: Integrations

description: Prefect integrations are PyPI packages you can install to help you build integrate your workflows with third parties.
---

## Install an integration library

Install an integration with `pip`.

For example, to use `prefect-aws`:

```bash
pip install -U prefect-aws
```

## Register blocks from an integration

Once the packages is installed, [register the blocks](/3.0rc/develop/connect-third-party/#registering-blocks-for-use-in-the-prefect-ui) within the integration to view them in the Prefect Cloud UI:

For example, to register the blocks available in `prefect-aws`:

```bash
prefect block register -m prefect_aws
```

To use a block's `load` method, you must have a block [saved](/3.0rc/develop/connect-third-party/#saving-blocks). [Learn more about blocks](/3.0rc/develop/connect-third-party).

## Using Tasks and Flows from an Integration

Integrations also contain pre-built tasks and flows that can be imported and called within your code.

For example, =read a secret from AWS Secrets Manager with the `read_secret` task with the following code:

```python
from prefect import flow
from prefect_aws import AwsCredentials
from prefect_aws.secrets_manager import read_secret

@flow
def connect_to_database():
    aws_credentials = AwsCredentials.load("MY_BLOCK_NAME")
    secret_value = read_secret(
        secret_name="db_password",
        aws_credentials=aws_credentials
    )

    # Use secret_value to connect to a database
```

## Customize tasks and flows from an integration

To customize pre-configured tasks or flows use `with_options`:
    
```python
from prefect import flow
from prefect_dbt.cloud import DbtCloudCredentials
from prefect_dbt.cloud.jobs import trigger_dbt_cloud_job_run_and_wait_for_completion


custom_run_dbt_cloud_job = trigger_dbt_cloud_job_run_and_wait_for_completion.with_options(
    name="Run My DBT Cloud Job",
    retries=2,
    retry_delay_seconds=10
)

@flow
def run_dbt_job_flow():
    run_result = custom_run_dbt_cloud_job(
        dbt_cloud_credentials=DbtCloudCredentials.load("my-dbt-cloud-credentials"),
        job_id=1
    )

if __name__ == "__main__":  
    run_dbt_job_flow()
```

## Create a custom block for use in an integration

Prefect welcomes community contributions of integration libraries.

Most integrations contain custom blocks to interact with third-party services.

Here's the process to create a custom block:

1. Subclass from `Block`.
1. Add a description alongside an `Attributes` and `Example` section in the docstring.
1. Set a `_logo_url` to point to a relevant image.
1. Create the `pydantic.Field`s of the block with a type annotation, `default` or `default_factory`, and a short description about the field.
1. Define the methods of the block.

For example, this is how the [Secret block is implemented](https://github.com/PrefectHQ/prefect/blob/main/src/prefect/blocks/system.py#L76-L102):

```python
from pydantic import Field, SecretStr
from prefect.blocks.core import Block

class Secret(Block):
    """
    A block that represents a secret value. The value stored in this block will be obfuscated when
    this block is logged or shown in the UI.

    Attributes:
        value: A string value that should be kept secret.

    Example:
        (wrap in tripple backticsk and *python* to render correctly in the docs)
        from prefect.blocks.system import Secret
        secret_block = Secret.load("BLOCK_NAME")

        # Access the stored secret
        secret_block.get()
        
    """

    _logo_url = "https://example.com/logo.png"

    value: SecretStr = Field(
        default=..., description="A string value that should be kept secret."
    )  # ... indicates it's a required field

    def get(self):
        return self.value.get_secret_value()
```

To view in Prefect Cloud or the Prefect server UI, [register the block](https://docs.prefect.io/develop/connect-third-party/#registering-blocks-for-use-in-the-prefect-ui).

## Create a Prefect integration library

### Generate a project

To help you get started with your integration, we've created a template that gives the tools you need to create and publish your integration.

Use the [Prefect Integration template](https://github.com/PrefectHQ/prefect-collection-template#quickstart) to get started creating an integration with a bootstrapped project!

### List a project in the integrations catalog

To list your integration in the Prefect integrations catalog, submit a PR to the Prefect repository adding a file to the `docs/integrations/catalog` directory with details about your integration. Please use `TEMPLATE.yaml` in that folder as a guide.

## Contribute fixes or enhancements to integrations

To fix an issue or add a feature to any Prefect-maintained ntegrations, please [propose changes through a pull request from a fork of the prefecthq/prefect repository](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request-from-a-fork).

1. [Fork the repository](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/fork-a-repo#forking-a-repository)
2. [Clone the forked repository](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/fork-a-repo#cloning-your-forked-repository)
3. Install the repository and its dependencies:

```
pip install -e ".[dev]"
```

4. Make desired changes
5. Add tests
6. Insert an entry to the Integration's CHANGELOG.md
7. Install `pre-commit` to perform quality checks prior to commit:
```
pre-commit install
```
8. `git commit`, `git push`, and create a pull request
